            <h1>What are smart contracts?</h1>
            <p>Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediaryâ€™s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.</p>
            <p>
         We create and deploy your smart contracts onto either the Polygon network or the Etherium network.
         We can help you get your next collection off and running.
